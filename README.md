# :rocket: Angular Deploy gh-pages Actions

![build-test](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/angular-deploy-ghpages-actions/workflows/build-test/badge.svg) [![View Action](https://img.shields.io/badge/action-marketplace-blue.svg?logo=github&color=orange)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/angular-deploy-ghpages-actions) [![Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/AhsanAyaz/angular-deploy-ghpages-actions.svg?logo=github)](https://github.com/AhsanAyaz/angular-deploy-ghpages-actions/releases)

This [GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions) will handle the deploy process of your angular application to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can configure what folder will be deployed once the build is created. Also, you can specify which branch to deploy to.

## Getting Started :muscle:

You can include the action in your workflow to trigger on any event that [GitHub actions supports](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows). If the remote branch that you wish to deploy to doesn't already exist the action will create it for you. Your workflow will also need to include the `actions/checkout` step before this workflow runs in order for the deployment to work.

You can view an example of this below.

```yml
name: Build and Deploy
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
jobs:
  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: All things angular
      uses: AhsanAyaz/angular-deploy-ghpages-actions
      with:
        github_access_token: ${{ secrets.ACCESS_TOKEN }} # see the Configuration section for how you can create secrets
        build_configuration: development # The build environment for the app. please look configurations in your angular.json
        base_href: /ngrx-workshop/   # make sure this corresponds to https://<your_username>.github.io/<base_href>/
        deploy_branch: gh-pages # The branch the action should deploy to.
        build_folder: dist # The folder where your project is supposed to be after running ng build by the action.
```

If you'd like to make it so the workflow only triggers on push events to specific branches then you can modify the `on` section.


## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

You have to configure the `with` portion of your workflow file so that the action works fine. See the usage of `with` in the example above. Fir the Github secret (ACCESS_TOKEN) or anything added later, `secrets` must be referenced using the bracket syntax and stored in the GitHub repositories `Settings/Secrets` menu. You can learn more about setting environment variables with GitHub actions [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv).

| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------- | -------- |
| `build_configuration`          | You can provide the configuration using which the action should create the build. If nothing is provided, it will run `ng build --prod` by default. See your angular.json file for configurations.                                                                                                                                                            | `with`           | **Yes**  |  "production"  |
| `base_href`          | Since gh-pages will deploy the app for https://yourgithubusername.github.io/repositoryname/, you need to provide this `base-href` in order to have your project working correctly, since the base-href won't be `'/'` in this case. .                                                                                                                                                            | `with`           | **No**  | "/" |
| `deploy_branch`          | The branch to which we'll deploy the build folder. .                                                                                                                                                            | `with`           | **No**  | "gh-pages" |
| `build_folder`          | The folder in which `ng build` provides its output. This is the folder which will be deployed to the `deploy_branch`. .                                                                                                                                                            | `with`           | **No**  | "./dist" |
| `run_lint`          | Runs the `ng lint` command behind the scenes to make sure the files are linted properly. .                                                                                                                                                            | `with`           | **No**  | "false" |
| `github_access_token` | Depending on the repository permissions you may need to provide the action with a GitHub personal access token instead of the provided GitHub token in order to deploy. You can [learn more about how to generate one here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line). **This should be stored as a secret**.                                                                                                 | `secrets / with` | **Yes**  |
